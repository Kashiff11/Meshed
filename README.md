## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

- Resourceful: I have improved in my ability to look for answers through different means. I will use my personal connections within and outside the GA community to seek out feedback and direction (when needed) through out this project.

### Weaknesses:

- Prioritization: I continue to focus on some of the superficial aspects of the project (i.e. styling, button placement). Scheduling will be crucially important.

### Opportunities:

- Knowledge: I continue to only have surface level knowledge of many concepts that we have learned. I'll use my schedule to focus on learning the concepts I need to fulfill minimal requirements before diving deeper into advanced concepts.

### Threats:

- Imposter Syndrome: continue to take some time daily to read "Elequent JavaScript".
